## DSPy: _Programming_â€”not promptingâ€”Foundation Models

**Documentation:** [DSPy Docs](https://dspy.ai/)

## ASYNC DSPY

This is a fork of DSPy that has been modified to be fully async. Underlying behavior is untouched, with the exception of global per-thread settings overrides. The goal of this fork is to maintain parity and release cadence with DSPy (which is not complex or a large time-sink, given that the vast majority of changes are spamming async/await on various methods). It aims to be a near-drop-in replacement for dspy.

The high-level changes are as follows:
- Calls to tools, metrics, and modules must be `awaited`
- Implementations of tools, metrics, and modules must be declared as async
  - Including `__call__`, `forward`
- The dspy `Settings` object is now passed forward into every `__call__` and `forward` method - as well as the callbacks - instead of being overridden globally on a per-thread basis
  - This allows multiple dspy instances to be used in the same thread without mutating the settings context of other running dspy instances

For examples on how to use dspy-async, see:
- [`react` unit test](tests/predict/test_react.py)
- [`tool` unit test](tests/primitives/test_tool.py)
- [`predict` unit test](tests/predict/test_predict.py)

DSPy is the framework for _programmingâ€”rather than promptingâ€”language models_. It allows you to iterate fast on **building modular AI systems** and offers algorithms for **optimizing their prompts and weights**, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.

DSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python. Instead of brittle prompts, you write compositional _Python code_ and use DSPy to **teach your LM to deliver high-quality outputs**.
